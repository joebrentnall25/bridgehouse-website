## Bridgehouse Website

## Design

The bridgehouse website was designed using Figma. 

Throughout the creation of these designs, I was in regular contact with the owner of the restaurant to gather requirments and their opinion on how the website would look.

To view my designs go to [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/qwlWlzycTH1aUNZsEr77LO/Bridgehouse?node-id=0%3A1).

I will be creating this site mobile-first. 

## Development



## Further Improvements

- Convert code over to React.Js to improve the speed and reusability of the site. 

- Add support for a custom room bookings section of the site that would use my own API hosted on the cloud.
